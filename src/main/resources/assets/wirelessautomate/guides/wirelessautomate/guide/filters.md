# Filters

Each machine face, for each type, has a **built-in filter** with no entry limit, plus two
[Filter Card](filter-card.md) slots. Open it with the **Edit** button on the router screen.

## Golden rule

| Situation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| No filter has entries | **Everything passes.** |
| The built-in filter or any card accepts | It passes. |
| Whitelist | Only what matches an entry passes. |
| Blacklist | Everything passes except what matches. |

At the source, the filter decides what **leaves**; at the destination, what **enters**.

## Entry types

| Rule | Example | Items | Fluids | Chemicals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Exact** | Iron ingot, water, hydrogen | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Tag** | `#c:ingots`, `#c:ores` | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Mod** | `@mekanism` | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## How to add

| Way | How |
| --- | --- |
| **Inventory** | Shift + click the item (for fluids and chemicals, a full bucket or tank). |
| **JEI** | Drag from the list onto the grid, or Shift + click in the list. You don't need the item. |
| **Typing** | Under **More**: `#tag`, `@mod` or, for chemicals, the id (`mekanism:hydrogen`). |

## Options

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Whitelist / blacklist** | Inverts the filter. |
| **Components** (items) | Ignore: enchanted pickaxe = pickaxe. Require: only identical. |
| **Stock** | At a destination, accept only up to N. At a source, always keep N. Click an entry to set it. |

Checking an item costs the same with 9 or thousands of entries: the filter is compiled.
