# Wireless Tank

<ItemImage id="wirelessautomate:storage_tank" scale="2" float="left" />

A tank for **many fluids at once**, as many as fit in the tier's capacity. Each fluid shows up in a
list, like the items in the [Wireless Chest](wireless-chest.md). Attached to a router, it trades
billions of mB at once.

## Capacity

Total in mB, all fluids added up.

| Tier | mB |
| --- | --- |
| **Basic** | 1,000,000 |
| **Advanced** | 64,000,000 |
| **Elite** | 4,000,000,000 |
| **Ultimate** | Unlimited |

## Buckets and containers

| I want to... | How |
| --- | --- |
| Empty a bucket | Click the Tank with the full bucket in hand, or Shift + click it in the screen's inventory. |
| Fill a bucket | Click the Tank with an empty bucket (takes the first fluid), or, on the screen, click the fluid with the bucket on the cursor. |
| Other containers | Tanks and cells from other mods work the same way, through the screen. |

On the screen, with a container on the cursor: clicking a fluid fills the container with it, or
empties it if it's already full; right click empties one. Search, order and resizing are the
Chest's.

## Input filter

The screen's **Filter** button opens the fluid [filter screen](filters.md): only what it accepts
gets in, and an entry's **stock** means "store up to N mB".

## Shared with the Chest

- **Tiers:** raised with the same [Upgrade Cards](upgrade-cards.md), in the world or in a crafting table, keeping the contents.
- **Breaking:** the item takes the contents and the filter, and the tooltip shows the total. A full one always becomes an item (in creative, without a pickaxe or in an explosion).
- **Comparator:** the signal rises with how full it is.
- **Other mods** see it as a regular tank.
